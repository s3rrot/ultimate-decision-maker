UDM (Ultimate Decision Maker) is a simple app to play around. It helps you (in a funny way) to take banal decisions without having to think too much.

You just have to think on a question you want the answer for:

Click on the button "Get the Answer" and *Voil√°*. You are going to have the problem solved. ;)

**Disclaimer**: UDM is not responsible for the decisions you finally make. Be aware that this is just a funny way to play around with trivial decisions like "Should we go to McDonald's for dinner?".
